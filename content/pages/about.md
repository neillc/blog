So, for the curious, who am I and what is this blog about?

Hi, I'm Neill and I've been mucking about with computers for a long time now.

I started playing with them in the 70s, the era of the TRS-80, CPM, Commodore Pet, Apple IIs and so on. My first computer was an [Exidy Sorcerer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exidy_Sorcerer) which my parents bought for me.  I'm not sure my Mum ever understood the fascination but Dad was a bit of a geek and that early start has stood me in good stead.

My current job is as a "Cloud Architect" with a particular focus on OpenStack.  My previous job was with Rackspace which was a great place to learn about OpenStack, and generally a great place to work.

I program in Python when I can, although I use other languages when appropriate. I have done a lot of work with SQL databases (and prefer PostgreSQL over MySQL and both of those over Oracle).

I use vim as my main editor (because I'm not smart enough to master emacs).

If you haven't guessed already, I am by preference a Linux user, but I will work with either Windows or Mac OS X as necessary.

I'm married, have six children and two grandchildren.

I am religious. Specifcally Roman Catholic and currently in formation for the permanant diaconate in the Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. The title of this blog came from my apporach to religion.  I believe, but I came to that belief from a very sceptical starting point. I still struggle with scepticism - I'm a very poor mystic, but I know and admire some deeply mystical people.

I'm always willing to engage in a respectful discussion of religion, but I really dislike shallow, dismissive and argumentative discussion of complicated matters. I'm not stupid, and I have thought deeply about what I believe. I don't expect you to agree with me and I am open to new data, but at this point I've heard a lot of arguments that have not convinced me to change my fundamental beliefs. Which is not to say I have finished learning - you may well be able to teach me something new and I have changed my position on a number of points, but I remain an orthodox Catholic.

Anyway, thanks for reading and feel free to contact me at neill.cox@ingenious.com.au

Cheers,
Neill
