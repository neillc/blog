Welcome to my nth (3rd? 4th? 5th?) attempt at keeping a blog.  I'm not very good at this, so we'll see how long this one lasts.

I have a hard time believing that my life is likely to be of much interest to anyone else, but I do accumulate stuff that I want
to remember so this is likely to serve as an exo-brain. Somewhere to put (mostly technical) things that I would like to remember.

I may occasionally wander off into other interests - theology, science fiction, roleplaying, photography and who knows what else
may catch my eye.

Mainly though this is likely to be about Linux, OpenStack, Ansible and maybe some other geeky devopsy things. If you're bothering 
to read this then I hope you find it either useful, interesting or at least entertaining.

Cheers,
Neill
